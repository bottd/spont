## Spont
Spont is effectivly the antithesis of a social network:  An App that requires no login and anonymously tracks a users' location for the sole purpose of finding exciting activities based on the user's similiarity of activities to other anonymous users'.

## Project Goals
* Build a simple yet elegant native application that fulfills the user's needs
* Stub in a method to track a user's location while the app is in the background (not available in React Native)
* Allow users the ability to see relavent activities in a geospacial manner.


## Set Up
